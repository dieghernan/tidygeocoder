Describe the bug and include a small reproducible example: https://www.tidyverse.org/help/ 

The datapasta package can be useful for including data in the reproducible example (see the `tribble_paste()` function): https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/

It can also be helpful to post the results of `devtools::session_info()` to show information about your R session including what package versions you are using.

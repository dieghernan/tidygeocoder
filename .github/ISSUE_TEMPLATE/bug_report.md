Describe the bug and include a small [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/). If you are using data read in from a file, the [datapasta package](https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/) can be useful for including data in the reproducible example (see the `tribble_paste()` function).

It can also be helpful to post the results of `devtools::session_info()` to shows information about your R session including what package versions you are using.
